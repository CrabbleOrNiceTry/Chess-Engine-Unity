# Chess-Engine-Unity
Port from my python chess engine into Unity

Clone and Play, hopefully!

I made this in Unity Linux, it should be the same and there shouldn't be any problems but maybe not. In hiendsiet I probably should have made this in Windows 
but I think it is fine. Plus, I hate Windows, so, no thanks.
